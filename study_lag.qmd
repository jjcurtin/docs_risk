### Study Overview

This study looks at EMA features for lagged prediction of lapse probability in the next week at the following hour intervals:   

- 0 (this is equivalent to our week model in the EMA paper)
- 24 (1 day out)    
- 72 (3 days out)
- 168 (1 week out)
- 336 (2 weeks out)   


### Label Decisions

Labels are complete     

- The first possible label for each participant starts `24 hours + lag time (in hours)` after their study start date.   
- The last possible label is 7 days before their last EMA (study end date/time) because we are predicting one week windows and want a each epoch to contain a full 7 days.     
- no_lape labels that are within 24 hours of a lapse are removed.    

### Feature Decisions

Features are complete    

- Features were made on CHTC. We are using the same feature set that was used in the EMA study except there is now a buffer (lag) between the epoch of features sampled and prediction window.
- `eda_demo_lag_functions` confirms the lag in our feature functions are working as expected.   
- Consider adding income and employment features?
