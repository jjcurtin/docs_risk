    "text": "1.1 GPS procedure\nParticipants current location was continuously tracked via GPS and WiFi positioning technology on individual cell phones and available to the A-CHESS program for the study duration (a total of three months of mobile monitoring).\nAt monthly intervals, during follow-up visits (at month 1, 2, and 3), participants were asked to identify whether frequently visited locations (i.e., &gt;2 times per month) were helpful or harmful to their recovery and what emotion was associated with the location (i.e., positive, negative, or mixed).\nMoves was used to track data from start of study until July 2018, after which FollowMee was used to capture participant geolocation data because the app was bought out by Facebook, and then subsequently was deprecated."
